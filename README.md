This repository demonstrates a common issue in PHP applications involving memory exhaustion when working with extensive datasets.  The `bug.php` file contains code that reproduces the problem. It creates a large array of large strings, which could lead to memory limits being exceeded. The solution, implemented in `bugSolution.php`, addresses this by using techniques to improve memory efficiency.

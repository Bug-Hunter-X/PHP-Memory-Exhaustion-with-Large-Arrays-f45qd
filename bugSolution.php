Several approaches can mitigate this issue:

1. **Memory Optimization:** Using iterators or generators to process large datasets in smaller chunks, avoiding loading everything into memory at once. This approach is particularly efficient for very large files or datasets.

2. **Memory Limit Adjustment:** Increase PHP's memory limit using `ini_set('memory_limit', '256M');` (adjust the value as needed) but this only masks the problem, not solves it.  It's vital to find the root memory issues instead of relying on this.  If memory limits consistently need to be raised it might indicate the code needs to be more memory efficient.

3. **Data Serialization:** When dealing with large datasets or objects, consider serializing and deserializing them to disk, thus reducing the amount of data residing in memory at any given time.  This is beneficial for temporary storage and recovery.

4. **Efficient Data Structures:** Use the most efficient data structure for your particular task. This might involve switching from arrays to optimized structures for specific situations.

```php
//Example of using a generator to handle large arrays
function largeArrayGenerator($size) {
    for ($i = 0; $i < $size; $i++) {
        yield str_repeat('a', 1024);
    }
}

foreach (largeArrayGenerator(1000000) as $item) {
    // Process $item
}
```

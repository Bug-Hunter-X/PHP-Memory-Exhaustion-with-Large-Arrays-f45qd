This code exhibits unexpected behavior when dealing with large arrays or strings. The issue stems from PHP's memory management and how it handles large data structures.  When the script processes a substantial amount of data, it might exceed the available memory, resulting in a fatal error or unexpected output.

```php
$largeArray = [];
for ($i = 0; $i < 1000000; $i++) {
    $largeArray[] = str_repeat('a', 1024); // Creates a large string
}
//Further operations on $largeArray might lead to memory exhaustion
```
